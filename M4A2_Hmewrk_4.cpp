	3. Display my menu to the potential clients
	4. Ask for their power level and input their levels
	5. Run this while loop
	6. Set switch to different levels base on users power level
	7. Assigned the correct function to each switch
	8. Create a for loop to display years
	9. Loop through through the calculation
	10. Quit after power level is over 9000!!!
